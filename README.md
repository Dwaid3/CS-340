How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The way that we ensure our program has these characteristics is to make sure we follow the principles of making your code modular. We need to be using methods as our base and ensuring that we are not hard coding anything that can change. We also broke things up into sections in our notebook which is a huge advantage it helps error finding so easy and more efficient. This CRUD model will definitely be used in any future project that I do that include data base creation.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach my problems by first making sure I understand the problem, and then brainstorm on the most efficient way to solve the problem. My approach to this project was very different as I was very careful with my code the first time I typed it. With my normal IDE I can catch any errors as soon as I type them, but jupyter notebooks really did not catch them until run time making it important to not sloppy type. The strategy that I will use in the future it testing my code with jupyter notebooks it was super cool and I was glad to learn it

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists expand their knowledge on a technological level and use that knowledge to solve all sorts of problems that the world has through technology. Its important as our society shifts towards this era of technology that we grow with it. This helps all companies not just Grazioso Salvare, this is because technology is the future and has a foothold in every thing.
